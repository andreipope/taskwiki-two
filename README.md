# two
_Task Wiki Opener_ 

**two** is designed to open (and create and list and search) [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org) related wiki files. It enhances [TaskWiki](https://github.com/tbabej/taskwiki), and can take advantage of [vim-template](https://github.com/aperezdc/vim-template) to quickly create and locate project wiki files.

* note: the above image doesn't show **two** in action, but it _does_ show vim-template-generated taskwiki files (and Tagbar, and NERDtree) that **two** is designed to juggle.

### Requirements
- [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/download/) -- If you're not using this command-line todo manager, to track you tasks, then not much of the following will apply to you. Try it out and come back later!
- [TaskWiki](https://github.com/tbabej/taskwiki) is the way to use taskwarrior tasks in
- [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/tree/tags) is a personal wiki for vim

follow the links above, these requirements have their own requirements, recommendations and install instructions.. there's a lot going on here, but it's worth the effort!

### Recommendations
- vim-template
- vim-tagbar
